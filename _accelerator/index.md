## Customer Segmentation: an Industry Accelerator on IBM Cloud Pak for Data

<br />

## What you will build
Industry Accelerators for Cloud Pak for Data 
https://community.ibm.com/community/user/cloudpakfordata/viewdocument/industry-accelerators-for-cloud-pak

The industry accelerators that are provided by IBM are a set of artifacts that help you address common business issues. Each accelerator includes a structured set of business terms. The glossaries provide the information architecture that you need to effectively analyze your data. Some of the accelerators also include sample data science assets that you can use to accelerate your analysis.


In this workshop, we'll use [IBM Cloud Pak for Data](https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data) to ...

In addition to exploring an industry accelerator, we'll also examine IBM Cloud Pak for Data and discuss the differences between public, private, and hybrid clouds.

What are Industry Accelerators?

The industry accelerators that are provided by IBM are a set of artifacts that help you address common business issues. Each accelerator includes a structured set of business terms. The glossaries provide the information architecture that you need to effectively analyze your data. Some of the accelerators also include sample data science assets that you can use to accelerate your analysis.

The Customer Segmentation accelerator includes a structured glossary of more than 100 business terms and a set of sample data science assets. The glossary provides the information architecture that you need to segment customers based on demographics and commonalities in client behaviour. Your data scientists can use the sample notebooks, predictive models, and dashboards to accelerate data preparation, machine learning modeling and data reporting. Since there aren't any predefinied segments we will need to discover those segments within the underlying data structure. Once that structure is found the clients will be assigned to their respective clusters. The segmentation helps you to understand how groups of customers differ from one another.
