In order for Cloud Pak for Data to read our Db2 Warehouse data we need to add a new Data Source to our Cloud Pak for Data project. This requires inputting the usual JDBC details.

To add a new data source, go to the (â˜°) menu and click on the Connections option.

At the overview, click Add connection.

Start by giving your new Connection a name and select Db2 Warehouse on Cloud as your connection type. More fields should appear. Fill the new fields with the same credentials for your own Db2 Warehouse connection from the previous section. Click Test Connection and, after that succeeds, click `Add`.
