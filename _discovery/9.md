## Finish
Now that our notebook is properly configured, we can simply step through the cells and watch it work!

### Running the notebook

When a notebook is executed, what is actually happening is that each code cell in the notebook is executed, in order, from top to bottom.

Each code cell is selectable and is preceded by a tag in the left margin. The tag format is In [x]:. Depending on the state of the notebook, the x can be:

A blank, this indicates that the cell has never been executed.
A number, this number represents the relative order this code step was executed.
A *, this indicates that the cell is currently executing.

For this workshop, there are two main ways to execute the code cells in your notebook:

1. **One cell at a time.**
Select the cell, and then press the Play button in the toolbar.

2. **Batch mode, in sequential order.**
From the Cell menu bar, there are several options available. For example, you can Run All cells in your notebook, or you can Run All Below, that will start executing from the first cell under the currently selected cell, and then continue executing all cells that follow.
