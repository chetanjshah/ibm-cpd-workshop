title: Setup our Database

> This step is **OPTIONAL**! In general you will be bringing data into your Cloud Pak for Data project from your own source. If you would like to work through the exercise of creating and seeding the data yourself, continue through these steps, otherwise continue to the next page and use the provided database credentials for a pre-seeded Db2 database.

We'll need a place to store our data. For this workshop we've opted to use Db2 Warehouse on IBM Cloud mainly because it simulates a realistic enterprise database which could be deployed in a number of ways to fit your needs. With IBM Cloud we will utilize the free Lite tier of Db2 for this workshop.

## Log in and provision a Db2 Warehouse database
**Log in** or **sign up** for [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/)

## Create Db2 Service
Go to the [dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com) of your IBM Cloud account and follow the steps to create your Db2 On Cloud service.

* In the search bar at the top of your dashboard, search `Db2`

* For the service name, enter in `housing-data-storage`.
* Scroll down to the `Pricing Plan` section and choose the `Lite` plan.
* Click `Create`

Once you have created your database instance, we can go back to the dashboard and click on the `View Resources` link under the `Resource Summary` section. You should then be able to see and verify that your Db2 instance has been created.

## Seed the data

From the dashboard of your Db2 service, select the option for `Open Console`.

* Click on `Load` under the hamburger menu

From the GitHub repository that you previously cloned, navigate to the `data` directory, this will act as our training dataset.

* Click on `browse files` and select `home-sales-training-data.csv` from your computer
* Click `Next`
* The next step is to decide where our data will be stored. Click on the first schema that shows up, then select `New Table`.

* Enter `HOME_SALES` as our table name and select `Create` and finally `Next`.
* Make sure the column names and datatypes are correct, and click `Next`.
* Click `Begin Load`.

Once the job has been completed, our data has finally been loaded into our database.

## Credentials
We will also want to keep the credentials for our Db2 instance handy so that we can connect to it later. From your Db2 service, click `Service Credentials`, you should see an option to create new or see existing credentials.
