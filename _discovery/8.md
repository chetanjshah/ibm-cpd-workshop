Select `Remote` then select `Insert to code` for your data set. This will create the necessary code to bring in the data from Db2 to our notebook.

## Watson Machine Learning
Since our CPD cluster comes with our own private instance of Watson Machine Learning installed, we can use the following credentials to connect to it:

```python
from watson_machine_learning_client import WatsonMachineLearningAPIClient
# wml_credentials = {    
#     "apikey": "<api key>",
#   "instance_id": "<instance id>",
#   "url": "<URL>"
# }

wml_credentials = {
    "url": "https://169.61.86.165",
    "instance_id": "icp",
    "username": "USERNAME",
    "password": "PASSWORD"
}
client = WatsonMachineLearningAPIClient(wml_credentials)
```

You will want to use that in the 5th step of the notebook.
