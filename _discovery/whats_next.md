Congratulations, you've made it! Our customer care app is now ready to use.
<br /><br />
You now have a working customer support application using Watson Discovery, Watson Assistant, and Cloud Functions. You can now use this knowledge as a basis for your own apps using these products. We can't wait to see what you build!

## Next steps
This workshop was based off of the following code pattern: [https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/enhance-customer-help-desk-with-smart-document-understanding](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/enhance-customer-help-desk-with-smart-document-understanding/). 
<br /><br />
Take a look and explore adding Smart Document Understanding to further enhance the queries to Discovery.

### Homework

### Benefits of Cloud Pak for Data for Developers
Cloud Pak for Data (CPD) represents an all-in-one platform for all your data needs. CPD tries to eliminate silos between Architect, Data Scientist, Developer, and Data Stewards. Cloud Pak for Data helps to streamline work by creating a pipeline for collecting, organizing, analyzing, and consuming data.

For developers, this provides numerous benefits. Some of the most important highlights include:

1. Data control and privacy
2. Have full control over where you want to have your applications and data
3. Seamless integration of all the tools you need to get your job done
