## Watson Machine Learning with IBM Cloud Pak for Data: Predicting Home Value

<br />

## What you will build
Data keeps on growing and deriving meaningful information out of that data is incredibly important. Using machine learning models from existing data helps a company to not only obtain useful insights, but also predict future results. In this workshop, we will walk through creating a machine learning model using [IBM Watson Machine Learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/machine-learning) and [IBM Db2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/db2) while utilizing [IBM Cloud Pak for Data](https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data).

<!-- In our scenario, we'll assume we have sensitive documents that cannot be placed on a public cloud, but we do need to interact with our customers over the web. Using SDU (or WKS), we'll enhance an [IBM Watson Discovery](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/discovery/) model so queries will be more focused to search the most relevant information found in TK. Finally, using [IBM Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/), we'll use a customer care dialog to handle a typical conversation between a customer and company representative. When a customer question involves operation of a product, the Assistant dialog will communicate with the Discovery service using webhooks.  -->

In this workshop, we'll use [IBM Cloud Pak for Data](https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data) to build a machine learning model trained and deployed with Watson Machine Learning to predict the value of a home based on historic data. 

In our scenario, we'll assume we have sensitive data around housing prices that cannot be placed on a public cloud, however, we still want to utilize established tools such as Watson Machine Learning to help streamline our model building. Together, we'll create a model which utilizes an  IBM Db2 instance to feed in data, Jupyter Notebooks to build the model, and a private instance of Watson Machine Learning to train and deploy the final model.

In addition to building a working model, we'll also explore IBM Cloud Pak for Data and discuss the differences between public, private, and hybrid clouds.
